# Silent failures — requests that look filed but aren't

The dangerous failure in this work is not the broker who refuses you. That one is
loud: you get a bounce, a "we don't accept email", a form that won't submit. You
know to try something else.

The dangerous failure is the one that **looks exactly like success**. You fill the
form, the page says thank you, the tracker says `submitted`, and nothing was ever
filed. Months later you are still listed, still being sold, and you believe you
opted out. Every hour spent on the loud failures is wasted if the quiet ones go
uncounted.

This file catalogues the ones actually encountered, so you can check for them
rather than discover them.

## The rule that catches all of them

**Record `submitted` only when the broker has handed you something.** A reference
number, a ticket ID, a confirmation email, a named human replying. Something that
came *from them* and that you could quote back.

Your own screenshot of a thank-you page is not that. It proves the page rendered;
it does not prove a record was created, and — as below — it does not even prove
the request said what you thought it said.

---

## 1. The form recorded a different request than you selected

**Seen on:** Epsilon (see `epsilon.md`)

A portal offering several request types (delete / do-not-sell / do-not-share)
where the wrong one silently stays selected. Three consecutive "Delete" requests
were logged as "Do not sell". The confirmation page is identical for every type,
so nothing on screen distinguishes them.

Root cause there: clicking a radio **by element reference** gave it a focus ring
without checking it, and the default option remained selected. A focused radio and
a selected radio differ by a few pixels.

**Check:** screenshot the radio group and confirm the circle is *filled*, not
merely outlined, before you fill anything else. If the broker emails a request ID
that names the request type, read it — that is your only independent confirmation.

**Why it matters beyond one broker:** delete and do-not-sell are not
substitutes. Opting out of sale while believing you requested deletion leaves the
record in place indefinitely.

## 2. The request needs a confirmation click you never made

**Seen on:** Epsilon (Delete), Affinity Solutions, PeopleFinders, Radaris

Deletion requests very often require email verification. The pattern:

> "One More Step! Your identity needs to be verified."

Until the emailed link is clicked, **the request does not exist**. The submission
page still congratulated you. Two ways this goes wrong:

- **Nobody clicks it.** The mail lands in a mailbox nobody watches, or arrives
  after you've moved on. One request sat unverified for a day, indistinguishable
  in the tracker from a completed one.
- **The link expires first.** PeopleFinders gives **24 hours**, states so plainly,
  and on expiry says: *"This link has already been used or has expired. Please
  restart the process."* Restarting there means solving a CAPTCHA again.
- **The link is corrupted in the plain-text part of the email.** Multi-part mail
  carries an HTML body and a plain-text fallback, and the fallback is where
  verification links get mangled. Two observed in this project: one lost the `=`
  and the first two characters of its signature, producing *"Security error,
  signature doesn't match"*; another lost the `=` from a `ticketid` parameter.
  Both look like a rejected or expired request rather than a truncated URL.

  **Always take the href from the HTML part**, not the text you can read. If a
  verification link fails with a signature or token error on first use, suspect
  the copy before you suspect the request.

**Check:** if a broker mentions verification at all, the request is not filed
until you have seen a page that says something like *"Your request is confirmed!"*
Treat submission and verification as **one** step. Search the mailbox for pending
"confirm your email" mail before every session — an unclicked link is a request
you have already paid for and not collected.

## 3. The address bounced

**Seen on:** several — see `_DEFLECTIONS.md` and CONTRIBUTING.md

A bounce arrives in a *different* mailbox thread from the one you sent, so it is
easy to miss. A bounced request and a pending request look identical in a tracker.

- **Hard bounce (550, "address not found")** — the published address is dead. The
  real contact is usually in the privacy policy or a state data-broker registry.
  `privacy@<domain>` published in a directory bounced while the working address
  was an ordinary support mailbox.
- **Soft bounce ("delivery incomplete", retrying)** — not yet a failure; the
  provider retries for ~48h. Don't re-send immediately, but don't just wait it
  out either — check the domain (below), because some of these never arrive.
- **DNS failure ("domain couldn't be found")** — the company is gone. Mark
  `unreachable`; there is nothing to chase.

**The soft bounce that is really a dead domain.** A broker whose DNS returns
SERVFAIL produces a *soft* bounce, not a hard one: the mail provider cannot tell
a broken nameserver from a temporarily unreachable one, so it reports "Delivery
incomplete... will retry for 47 more hours" and keeps trying. For two days the
request sits in the tracker looking pending, and only then fails — if you are
still watching by that point.

Check any soft bounce that survives its first day:

```bash
host <domain>            # SERVFAIL or NXDOMAIN means it will never arrive
host -t MX <domain>      # no MX means no mail route even if the domain resolves
```

Two brokers in this project turned out to be dead this way. One announced itself
immediately with "the domain couldn't be found"; the other spent 24 hours looking
like an ordinary slow delivery. Same outcome, very different visibility.

**Check:** search for delivery-status mail *first* in every pass, before replies.

## 4. The form silently discarded what you typed

**Seen on:** Epsilon, Spokeo, LexisNexis, Acxiom, PeopleSearchNow

Several variants, all ending with a field that is empty when you thought it was
filled:

- **`form_input` reports success and leaves the box empty.** Common on
  React-controlled inputs. The tool says it worked. It did not.
- **The page moves between your click and your keystrokes.** Content loading below
  re-anchors the viewport; the click lands correctly, the text goes nowhere. Worse,
  with no field focused those keystrokes can land on *other controls* and change
  them.
- **An entry was typed but never committed.** Forms with "Add Person" / "+" buttons
  discard the typed value unless you press the button, and only complain at the
  very end.
- **An ad overlay resets the form.** A vignette interstitial wiped a completed form
  on one site; a layout shift invalidated element references on another.
- **Values shift down by one field.** Dismissing a cookie banner mid-form moved
  every entry into the next box — the city landed in the State dropdown and
  silently set the wrong state, which would have misstated residency on a legal
  request.

**Check:** screenshot and read the values back before submitting. For fiddly
forms, click *one* field by coordinate, confirm the caret is in it, then **Tab**
between the rest — tab order is immune to the page moving. Verify dropdowns
individually; they often accept programmatic input when text boxes don't.

## 5. The auto-reply was a gate, not a receipt

**Seen on:** Brandwatch

An automated acknowledgement that reads like confirmation, and is actually a
conditional. Buried below the reassuring opening:

> *"If you believe we have collected data on you as a Content Author, please reply
> to this email indicating your desire for us to proceed with your request."*

Nothing happens until you reply. The message opens with *"We confirm receipt of
your message"*, which is exactly the artifact you were told to wait for, so it is
easy to file as done and move on. The request then sits unprocessed forever, with
a receipt in the mailbox proving it was received.

The tell is a conditional in the auto-reply: *if you believe... please reply*, *if
this applies to you, complete...*, *should you wish to proceed, confirm...* Any
sentence putting the next move back on you means the request is parked.

**Check:** read auto-replies to the end rather than filing them on the strength of
the first line. If the body asks for anything at all — a confirmation, a category
choice, a form — the request is not filed until you supply it.

**Then check that your confirmation reached a person.** Replying to the address
the auto-reply came *from* can simply trigger it again: a confirmation sent to
`PrivacyAutoreplyBW@` returned the identical canned message, leaving no way to
tell whether anyone saw it. Send confirmations to the **monitored** address you
originally wrote to, not to the auto-responder, and say you are re-sending and
why. Two identical auto-replies in a thread is the tell.

**Related trap: the category fork.** The same reply split requests into "Users"
(indexed on business email) and "Content Authors" (indexed on social handle), with
different scopes and different answers. Picking the wrong one, or not picking, gets
a truthful "we hold no data about you" that only answers the category you did not
mean. Answer both explicitly.

## 6. The submission failed on their end

Not every failure is subtle. A correctly completed form can return a plain
server-side error:

> *"Error submitting URL — Your request could not be submitted at this time,
> please try again later or contact us by email or phone."*

Worth stating because the instinct is to assume you did something wrong and go
looking for the mistake. Nothing was wrong with the request. The fix is to
re-stage and submit again, and — if it fails twice — use the phone or postal route
rather than continuing to feed a broken endpoint.

**Record it as unfinished, not submitted.** A form that errored is exactly as
unfiled as one never started, and the CAPTCHA you just solved is spent.

## 7. The request was filed against the wrong identity

Brokers index on prior addresses and disconnected phone numbers as much as current
ones. A request naming only your current details can be honestly processed and
still leave several records untouched — the broker will tell you they found
nothing, and be telling the truth.

**Check:** list every email, prior address, and old phone number on every request.

**The sharper version: some brokers index on *nothing* you sent.** Several
categories are searchable only by a key the standard letter never contains —
social handles, phone numbers, VIN or plate, device or advertising IDs. There the
letter is not merely incomplete, it is unanswerable, and a truthful "no records
found" is the expected reply. Read what the broker says it indexes on, and send
that. See `_CATEGORY_VARIANTS.md`.

**The mirror failure: the identifier you cannot produce.** Some forms require a
key the consumer does not have — a device ID for a TV-advertising deletion, a
profile URL that the public search never exposes. Check whether a *different*
request type on the same form has a lower bar: one broker gated Access and Delete
behind a device ID while offering a full household opt-out on address alone.
Picking the achievable request beats abandoning the form, as long as you record
which right remains unexercised and why.

## The pass that catches these

1. **Bounces before anything else.** A bounce invalidates a request you have
   already recorded as sent.
2. **Unclicked verification links.** Search for pending "confirm your email" mail;
   these expire.
3. **Request IDs against intent.** Where a broker names the request type back to
   you, read it rather than assuming.
4. **Re-check listings after the stated window.** See `verify_removals.py`. A
   submission is not a removal, and records reappear.
